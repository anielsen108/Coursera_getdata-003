The "run_analysis.R" script prepares Samsung Human Activity Recognition for further analysis.  It transforms the raw data into a data set consisting of mean and standard deviation measures, summarized by Subject and Activity Name.

To run it, place the script and the Samsung data folder "UCI HAR Dataset" in the working directory.

CodeBook.MD describes each column in the resulting output, "UciHarTidy.csv", and the method of data transformation.
